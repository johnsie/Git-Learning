Atomic Commits
When possibe a commit should encompass a single feature change or fix.

Add the files for one change, do the commit
Add the files from the other change,do the commit
To add all contents in a folder to staging:

git add foldername/

Git documentation official recommends commit messages are present tense imperative mood
"Make this happen"
instead of 
"I did this"


To remove a file from the staging index
git reset "filename.text"

To remove all files from the staging index
git reset



In larger projects a commit -m might not be enough. Instead do:
git commit
And write the commit message a text editor

To change the default editor
git config --global  core.editor "'file address of editor'"
(Some editors require a  --wait parameter so check table at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config)

Git log formatting options
git log --oneline
(See documentation for further options)



Amending a commit with amend

If you accidentally commit a mistake
Only works if you haven't done any more commits
git add forgottenfilename
git commit --amend
This opens up the message editor so you can change the original commit message




Git ignore
To tell git to ignore certain files. Maybe secret files containing private data or system files
Create a file called .gitignore which has a list of files and folders  that you want git to ignore
To see examples have a look at the .gitigore files in some big github projects
